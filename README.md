# basiconverters
<b>Why?</b>
The point of this project is to have fun while doing something useful. Converters! Starting timid with money conveters, moving on to degrees and quantities.
The code is MIT because I want anyone to have access to the code and use it for good only. (Doooh!)
Android has changed A LOT in the past years and keeping up to date with it can be daunting.

I love the idea of having my own apps that I keep for my own personal use, away from profiling and tracking. This is one of them.

<b>Tech stack:</b>
<ul>
<li>Android Studio - current version 3.6.1</li>
<li>Androidx packages</li>
<li>Sqlite with nl.qbusict:cupboard: because I want to have minimal 3rd Libraries that are simple and simple to use</li>
<li>Retrofit for requests</li>
<li>compileSdkVersion 29</li>
<li>buildToolsVersion "29.0.2"</li>
</ul>

Happy Coding!
